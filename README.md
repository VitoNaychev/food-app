# Food-app
Food delivery application for my bachelor's thesis. Until commit 00d418d there existed two separate service repos.
A design descision was made to merge these two repos into one to ease testability and maintainability, as for right now
I am a team of one, so there is no need for a repo-per-service-per-team approach in version controlling. Because of this
descision checking out to commits before 00d418d will show correct file history, but the projects might not be buildable.
